## Subclassing Project

-- this is an example. you should name your README in your repository as README.md. This is a separate file because I do not want to cause you any merge conflicts! 

I am planning to add **Monopoly Deal** as a Card Game. 

## TODO list 
  - [x] 2/13 Make sure I understand the code by adding a small feature (change the Card class to add drawing a standard card deck, allow replays, add a button to sort the cards by suit and value) 
  - [x] 2/18 For Monopoly Deal extend CardGame, create the different deck cards
     - Subclasses of MonopolyCard ($ value) is BankCard, PropertyCard, and Action 
  - [ ] 2/20 MonopolyHand extends Hand, and in the hand, players have a properties array and a bank: an array of MoneyCards. allow to place separately on the board.
  - [ ] 2/25 Allow to run playCard() up to three times before switching turns, and determine isValidPlay() if you can charge rent on if you have any properties; can charge broke ppl, can run deals 
  - [ ] 2/27 Make a MonopolyComputer to make the right decisions. 
  - [ ] 3/2 Ambitious: Deal Breaker!! (hard, not necessary, but the game is better because of it) Add House/Hotel subclasses (kinda boring), Just Say No
